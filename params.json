I got my BS in engineering / applied maths from Ecole Centrale Paris in France. I'm a decent programmer, a decent mathematician, but a terrible engineer: don't ask me to build a bridge, I would know where to start.\r\n\r\n### Open Projects\r\nI currently have only one non work-related project: a code generator for generic gibbs samplers in R. It is still in early development, but will be pushed to github soon.\r\n\r\n","google":"","name":"Guillaume Basse","tagline":"Research, interests, ..."}
